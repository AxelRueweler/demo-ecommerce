The third part is a small wind-protected outside porch with an additional tent entrance. The DualFlow ventilation system provides great air exchange through all parts of the Kreta 5. The colour coding helps with the pitching of the tent, which comes complete with an oversized carrying bag.</p>\

\	The lightweight Broxton Bermuda for men is an ideal short pant for all mountain and outdoor sports. The light and stretchable fabric has a very technical look and features DRY PLUS moisture technology, which guarantees reliable moisture transport and maximum comfort. As a result, the pant dries quickly and the skin never feels wet or overheated. In addition, the Polygiene&reg; antimicrobial technology safely inhibits the growth of odour-causing bacteria and fungi. Polygiene&reg; does not affect the natural bacterial flora of your skin, and without odour-causing bacteria, you stay fresh. Thanks to the comfortable cut and stretch fabric, the Broxton Bermuda is also great for bouldering or climbing, allowing unrestricted freedom of movement. Two open front pockets, one zipped safety front pocket, and two zipped back pockets offer plenty of space for small items.</p>\

<p>\
\	The Millen Light hardshell jacket for women was designed for the most demanding alpinists. The three-layer jacket features the effective Airflow ventilation system and the high-performance AQUAMAX&reg; 20.20 membrane, which allows the fabric of the Millen Light to transport moisture away from the skin. At the same time, the fabric is reliably wind- and waterproof. A storm hood with visor for additional rain protection, fully taped seams, and waterproof zippers support this function. The jacket&rsquo;s stretch fabric offers unrestricted freedom of movement. The two front pockets are positioned higher than usual for easy access when a backpack is carried. Sleeves, hem, cuffs, and storm hood can be individually adjusted for perfect fit and protection.</p>\

\	<div>\
\	\	of movement while supporting and protecting the Achilles</div>\
\	<div>\

\	<div>\
\	\	new Butterfly footwear technology, featuring the new Butterfly</div>\
\	<div>\
\	\	Shank and the Butterfly Lacing Support. The Butterfly Shank is a</div>\

\	<div>\
\	\	the forefoot that allows a smooth and stable impact when the foot</div>\
\	<div>\
\	\	hits the ground. It also provides torsional stability and strength</div>\
\	<div>\
\	\	to the midfoot, thus supporting an easy toe-off. The new Butterfly</div>\
\	<div>\
\	\	Lacing Support is a &bdquo;wrap-around&ldquo; lacing design that links the</div>\
\	<div>\
\	\	classic metal-hook lacing to the boot&rsquo;s upper for a more individual</div>\
\	<div>\

\	PRO TOUCH&rsquo;s top trail running shoe Ridge Trail AQM for men is fully equipped and designed for serious trail action. The rough Pro Grip outsole is made of a special rubber compound offering superior grip on every terrain and surface. The Ridge Trail AQM was also designed to offer a maximum of comfort, which is realized by integrating a Cushion Fit midsole that reliably absorbs shock while being extremely lightweight. PRO TOUCH&rsquo;s Quick Lace System provides an evenly distributed pressure around the entire foot, resulting in a significantly improved tight and comfortable fit. Since you should always be prepared for any kind of weather, the Ridge Trail features an upper made of light canvas, mesh, and synthetics with an integrated waterproof, windproof, and breathable Aquamax&reg; membrane. This technology does not only keep the rain out, it also regulates the foot climate and keeps you comfortable and dry inside your shoes at all times. Last, but not least, a well cushioned and pre-moulded OrthoLite&reg; insole guarantees additional breathability and avoids odours and bacteria that may develop around the foot during long and intense runs.</p>\

\	The women&rsquo;s version of the Chicago Stability running shoe was adapted to women&rsquo;s specific needs. It&rsquo;s a comfortable and breathable running shoe for beginners to intermediate runners, offering plenty of guidance for a neutral gait. The shoe features an anatomically shaped and pre-moulded I-Shape insole for superior stability and fit. The Cushion Fit midsole construction of the Chicago Stability is designed to reliably absorb shock and provide high comfort. The weight of the Cushion Fit midsole is reduced to the minimum, without compromising its durability. Whilst reducing the overall weight of the shoe, the stability was improved by integrating a Control Bridge moulded arch support around the midfoot area. The advanced Dura Grip outsole material provides enhanced grip and added durability for road running.</p>\

For a sock-like fit and maximum comfort, the New York from PRO TOUCH&rsquo;s RUNlight collection is made of the lightest, yet durable performance materials available. This starts with a synthetic mesh/PU mix of the upper construction, which delivers an incredible light feeling. At the same time the material is soft, breathable, and still stable enough to provide enough foothold around the ankle for a safe run. The low-weight internal Pro Bridge delivers the energy from impact to toe-off to allow a smooth and efficient running style.

In combination with the lightweight Pro Cushion midsole construction with focus on rear and forefoot cushioning, this lightweight midsole provides superior shock absorption and durability at minimal weight.

The low-weight internal Pro Bridge delivers the energy from impact to toe-off to allow a smooth and efficient running style. For a dry and odourless climate inside the New York W, the anatomically shaped and pre-moulded OrthoLite&reg; insole is breathable, moisture wicking, and anti-microbial. In combination with the lightweight Pro Cushion midsole construction with focus on rear and forefoot cushioning, this lightweight midsole provides superior shock absorption and durability at minimal weight. The shoe&rsquo;s non-marking Dura Grip rubber outsole guarantees reliable grip on all surfaces and additional cushioning.</p>\

\	If you need extra warmth on your trekking expedition or hiking trip without a bulky feel and excessive weight, the Lanila padded jacket with PrimaLoft&reg; insulation is probably one of the most functional jackets you can bring. The Lanila can be worn as an insulating mid layer or as an outer layer. A durable water repellent finish makes sure that you don&rsquo;t get soaked. And even if the PrimaLoft&reg; padding should ever get moist or wet, it won&rsquo;t loose any of its insulating properties. In addition, the PrimaLoft&reg; fibres are inside a wind-breaking, high-density Polyamide fabric that blocks the wind to keep you warm. Two front pockets and one external chest pocket offer plenty of space for all your valuables, and the elastic binding cuffs guarantee a comfortable and tight fit. The entire jacket, including its storm hood, packs into its own internal pocket, so you can always bring it along.</p>\

\	If you need extra warmth on your trekking expedition or hiking trip without a bulky feel and excessive weight, the Lanila padded jacket with PrimaLoft&reg; insulation is probably one of the most functional jackets you can bring. The Lanila can be worn as an insulating mid layer or as an outer layer. A durable water repellent finish makes sure that you don&rsquo;t get soaked.

In addition, the PrimaLoft&reg; fibres are inside a wind-breaking, high-density Polyamide fabric that blocks the wind to keep you warm. Two front pockets and one external chest pocket offer plenty of space for all your valuables, and the elastic binding cuffs guarantee a comfortable and tight fit. The entire jacket, including its storm hood, packs into its own internal pocket, so you can always bring it along.</p>\

\	The Millen Light hardshell jacket for women was designed for the most demanding alpinists. The three-layer jacket features the effective Airflow ventilation system and the high-performance AQUAMAX&reg; 20.20 membrane, which allows the fabric of the Millen Light to transport moisture away from the skin. At the same time, the fabric is reliably wind- and waterproof. A storm hood with visor for additional rain protection, fully taped seams, and waterproof zippers support this function. The jacket&rsquo;s stretch fabric offers unrestricted freedom of movement. The two front pockets are positioned higher than usual for easy access when a backpack is carried. Sleeves, hem, cuffs, and storm hood can be individually adjusted for perfect fit and protection.</p>\

<p>\
\	The perfect pant for rock climbers needs to be abrasion resistant, yet elastic enough to guarantee that none of their moves are restricted. McKINLEY&rsquo;s Mountain-Tec Northfield pant for women achieves both: reinforced areas like the inner leg bottoms, the knees and the seat for additional abrasion resistance, as well as a double-weave robust stretch fabric for full freedom of movement. The fabric of the Northfield pant is equipped with DRY PLUS moisture and boasts a durable water repellent finish and is thus wind and water resistant, breathable, moisture wicking, and fast-drying. The bottom hem is elastic and adjustable. To avoid that you get lost on your way to the top, the thigh pocket is large enough to fit a map.</p>\

\	The women&rsquo;s Broxton Bermuda is a lightweight short pant for all mountain and outdoor sports. The light and stretchable fabric has a very technical look and features the DRY PLUS moisture technology, which guarantees reliable moisture transport and maximum comfort.

In addition, the Polygiene&reg; antimicrobial technology safely inhibits the growth of odour-causing bacteria and fungi. Polygiene&reg; does not affect the natural bacterial flora of your skin, and without odour-causing bacteria, you stay fresh. Thanks to the comfortable feminine cut and the stretchy fabric, the Broxton Bermuda is also great for bouldering or climbing, allowing unrestricted freedom of movement. An unnoticeable internal waist adjustment system offers individual fit and comfort. Two open front pockets and one zipped safety front pocket offer plenty of space for small items.</p>\

\	<strong>Lanila 60 wms</strong></p>\
<p>\
\	If you need extra warmth on your trekking expedition or hiking trip without a bulky feel and excessive weight, the women&rsquo;s Lanila padded jacket with PrimaLoft&reg; insulation is not only one of the most functional jackets you can bring, but probably one of the best looking, too. The Lanila can be worn as an insulating mid layer or as an outer layer. A durable water repellent finish makes sure that you don&rsquo;t get soaked. And even if the PrimaLoft&reg; padding should get moist or even wet, it won&rsquo;t loose any of its insulating properties. Besides, the PrimaLoft&reg; fibres are enclosed by a wind-breaking, high-density Polyamid fabric that blocks the wind to keep you warm. Two front pockets and one external chest pocket offer plenty of space for all your valuables, and the elastic binding cuffs guarantee a close and comfortable fit. The entire jacket, including a storm hood, packs into an internal pocket, so you can bring it along anywhere, anytime.</p>\
